# General Graph Designer

https://www.magnacogita.com/graph

How to use this repo:
Clone it.

Strictly speaking only ./www/graph.js and ./www/index.html are required
in order to run the graph designer application in-browser
at that point, although it is recommended to host them on
a server.

If you wish to make any changes to any of the .js files
within ./src/ and subdirectories, upon saving your changes,
run the build.py script, which will combine all the .js files
from within ./src/ and place the result into ./www/graph.js
