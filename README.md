# Finite State Machine Designer

This is a simple update (for personal needs) of [ewanw's](http://madebyevan.com/fsm/) project.

To publish this project to GitHub Pages we need to use the ```build.py``` file that I fixed for Python 3.x versions. Specifically using the command:

```
python3 build.py
```

>**NOTE:** In some operating systems it is sufficient to use ```python``` and not ```python3```.

The file ```fsm.js``` will be created within the ```www/``` directory.

That's it!
